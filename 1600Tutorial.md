# How to know the difference of bitmapped images vs vector graphics
### By Gabe Sisk
#### The purpose to explain how to tell these 2 types of images apart and how to know when they will be used. [Here is a link to my previous work on this topic.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RiZMuw4Itiw-WdfwHYqYIz5tDDGJz_rAMZb0y0Nq06Y/edit?usp=sharing) My new work on my tutorial can be found [here.](https://github.com/GabeS1/GabeS1/blob/main/SVGTutorial.md)
#### Target audience for this would be entry level IT students or possibly even graphic design students. So this could be anyone from 18 to 22 or graduates.
